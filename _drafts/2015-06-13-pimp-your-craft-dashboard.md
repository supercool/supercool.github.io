## Yo yo yo

At Supercool we do a thing for each client where we create a specific dashboard for the project. This is simply to make it easier for any user to find the right section in the cp. Sometimes its really confusing coming to a site for the first time, even if youâ€™ve used plenty of other content management systems as each site can be set up in any number of different ways. Equally, it can be hard to remember where everything is if you are not constantly using the system. To get around this we do two things:

1. Give the client a built in help section, we initially wrote our own little plugin to do this but since then 70kft released [Craft Help](https://github.com/70kft/craft-help/) which does exactly what ours does, but better.

2. Create a custom dashboard widget that acts as a starting point for anyone coming to the control panel.

This last one is really a big win with the clients, and an easy one to implement.
